			<div style="margin-top: 2em; font-weight: bold;">Giving hope to our most HURTING, FORGOTTEN and MARGINALIZED urban teenagers and young adults through the clean redemptive work of the cross in the blurred and sometimes very messy reality of the urban city, using all means possible.</div>

								Reaching those that society as a whole have swept under the carpet, those that have shrunk into the shadows, those few if any know what to do with, those society wish would just disappear. Those looked at as the marginalized, the outcast, those with no hope, those that many think are beyond redemption, many times these are looked at as some of the worst of the so called “sinners”. 
							<p>
								The majority of this group will never fit into any church or even organized. They are the ones that are found on the corners of many of our urban blocks, on a bench locked up in a police station or in our court systems, or on a hospital bed, or dying in our prisons, many are just wondering homeless in the deep recesses of our streets. 
							<p>
								They are our marginalized teenagers and young adults, they are our orphans and unwed mothers, the homeless and hungry, they are some of our most hurting segments of society, those thinking they are locked in a desperate dark cycle of failure and destruction with no hope. 
							<p>
								We become a shepherd and parent, as our Shepard and Father in heaven, teaching and leading this group away from the slaughter they are facing; by bringing justice, a loving kindness, mercy and true redemption through the cross of Jesus. 
							<p>
								This can only be done through a deep investment of personal time and resource, through negating our personal rights and by “washing the feet” of those stuck in the trenches of muck, by literally becoming a “servant of the least of these”. By walking alongside each in their daily routine bringing us to the corner on the block where everyone hangs out, to the jail where one is waiting, to the courts as they face a judge, to the hospitals where there is many times deep affliction and pain, or to the prisons where one may or may not be getting out any time soon. 
							<p>
								And then, sharing hope, an answer or even being a friend humbly walking with one into a school, church or small group representing Christ, or helping one find their way through a legal or personal mess. Each depending on the depth and situation one might find themselves in. Being prepared to lay your life down in true unadulterated love that another might find their true life in Christ.
							<p>
								In order to do this we need to rethink the way we do things, we can no longer go by the status quo, we can no longer stand in the “comfortable”. It will involve a new dance, a new way of thinking which may be very unconventional, with a lot of stepping in the mess of another. We will need to think and go beyond the four walls of the church viewing the streets as the church, the homes, hospitals, jails and prisons as the pews and the people and gangs as a congregation, looking at each of these as sons and daughters and then treat each accordingly, understanding there will be many uncontrollable tears with extreme pain due to the deep sin and consequences that sin has flung all around. 
							<p>
								We will have to deeply live out the loving forgiveness God has shown us, realizing that those who have experienced great sin being forgiven greatly are also the ones who can forgive and love deeper than most, understanding those who have experienced little and been forgiven little are the ones who have a hard time forgiving and loving in real terms. 
							<p>
								We will need to understand in doing so we will be reaching not only onto the doorstep of hell but into the chambers of hell itself rescuing many from the grasps of Satan’s wolves who only want to steal, kill and destroy all they can. 
							<p>
								And in the process, some will find true hope, a new outlook, a peace that knows no bounds, and a life that is truly changed. A life only realized through the redemption of Jesus Christ on His cross of salvation! This is our vision!
